**Simple Calculator App**
**Overview**

This project is a web-based calculator application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator also includes optional challenges, such as handling decimal numbers, implementing a 'clear' function, adding a delete function, and a calculation history feature.

**Features**
**User Interface**

The application includes the following elements in its user interface:

Numeric buttons (0-9)

Basic operation buttons (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)

Equals button for executing calculations

Display area to show results

**Decimal Handling:** Allows users to input and calculate decimal numbers for more precise calculations.

**Clear Function:** Resets the calculator's state, providing a clean slate for new calculations.

**Delete Function:** Removes the last entered digit, allowing users to correct input errors.

**Calculation History:** A history button to toggle and review previous operations.

**Compatibility**

The calculator is designed to be compatible with keyboard inputs. Users can utilize the following keyboard buttons for enhanced functionality:

**Numeric digits (0-9):** Input numbers directly from the keyboard.

**Decimal point (.):** Add decimal numbers for more precise calculations.

**Basic operation keys (+, -, \*, /, %):** Perform arithmetic operations directly from the keyboard.

**Enter key:** Execute calculations without using the mouse.

**Backspace key:** Remove the last entered character for correction.

**Functionality**

The calculator app implements logic to perform arithmetic operations based on user inputs, providing accurate and reliable results. Error management is incorporated, with specific attention given to handling division by zero scenarios, enhancing the user experience by preventing unexpected issues.

**Technology Stack**

The project is built using the following technologies:

**HTML:** Providing the structure and layout of the web application.

**CSS:** Styling the user interface for a visually appealing experience.

**JavaScript:** Implementing the logic for arithmetic operations and user interactions.

**Usage**

To use the calculator app:

Open the index.html file in a web browser.

Click on the numeric buttons to input numbers.

Use the basic operation buttons to select the desired arithmetic operation.

Press the equals button to view the result in the display area.
